<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Diesel Engine (Non-Road) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-cooled engine</li><li>Air-cooled engine</li><li>Oil-cooled engie</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small diesel engine market can be categorized into three types based on cooling systems - water-cooled, air-cooled, and oil-cooled engines. Water-cooled engines use a water jacket to dissipate heat generated during combustion, providing consistent temperature control. Air-cooled engines rely on airflow over fins to cool down the engine, making them simpler and lighter. Oil-cooled engines use oil as a coolant and transfer heat away to maintain engine temperature. Each type of cooling system has its advantages and is used in various applications within the non-road sector.</p></p>

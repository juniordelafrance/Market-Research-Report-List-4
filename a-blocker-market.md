<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The α-blocker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>α-blockers are divided into two market types: Non-selective Antagonists and Selective Antagonists. Non-selective Antagonists block all α-adrenergic receptors, leading to potential side effects such as dizziness and low blood pressure. Selective Antagonists target specific subtypes of α-adrenergic receptors, reducing side effects while still effectively treating conditions like high blood pressure. Both types of α-blockers are used to relax smooth muscle tissue and improve blood flow, but Selective Antagonists may offer a more targeted and personalized approach to treatment.</p></p>

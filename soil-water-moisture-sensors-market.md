<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Water Moisture Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil Water Potential</li><li>Volumetric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil water moisture sensors come in two main types: soil water potential sensors and volumetric water content sensors. Soil water potential sensors measure the energy required for water to move within soil, providing information on how easily plants can extract water. Volumetric water content sensors, on the other hand, directly measure the amount of water in the soil as a percentage of the total soil volume. Both types of sensors are important tools for farmers and researchers to monitor and manage soil moisture levels.</p></p>

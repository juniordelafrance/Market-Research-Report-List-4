<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Devices are medical devices used to treat irregular heartbeats. There are two main types of devices on the market: Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery. Catheter Ablation involves the use of a catheter to deliver energy to the heart tissue and create scar tissue to block abnormal electrical signals. Maze Surgery is a more invasive procedure where a surgeon creates a pattern of scar tissue on the heart to redirect electrical signals. Both methods aim to restore normal heart rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation.</p></p>

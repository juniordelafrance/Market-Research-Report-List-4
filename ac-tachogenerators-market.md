<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Tachogenerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Induction Tachogenerators</li><li>Synchronous Tachogenerators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC Tachogenerators are devices used to measure the rotational speed of machinery. There are two main types: Induction Tachogenerators and Synchronous Tachogenerators. Induction Tachogenerators operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction, producing an output voltage proportional to the speed of rotation. Synchronous Tachogenerators generate a constant output voltage directly proportional to the speed of rotation, by using a permanent magnet and rotating coil. Both types are widely used in industrial applications to monitor and control the speed of motors and other rotating equipment.</p></p>

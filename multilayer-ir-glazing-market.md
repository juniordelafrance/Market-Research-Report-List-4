<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multilayer IR Glazing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CoatedGlass</li><li>ReflectingGlass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multilayer IR glazing market consists of two main types: coated glass and reflecting glass. Coated glass is designed with a thin layer of material that helps to reflect infrared radiation, reducing heat transfer and improving energy efficiency. Reflecting glass, on the other hand, is typically made with a metallic or reflective coating that reflects infrared radiation back into the environment, reducing heat gain and making it a popular choice for buildings in hot climates. Both types of multilayer IR glazing offer energy-saving benefits and improved comfort in indoor spaces.</p></p>

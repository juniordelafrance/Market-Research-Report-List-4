<p><h1>Implanted Stent Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Implanted Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>An implanted stent is a small mesh tube placed in an artery or vein to help keep it open and allow blood to flow more easily. Stents are commonly used in procedures such as angioplasty to treat blocked or narrow blood vessels. The global implanted stent market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period.</p><p>The growth of the implanted stent market can be attributed to factors such as the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising geriatric population, and advancements in stent technology. Additionally, the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures and the increasing demand for stents in emerging economies are also driving market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the implanted stent market is the development of bioresorbable stents, which gradually dissolve in the body after they have served their purpose. This technology eliminates the need for long-term medication and reduces the risk of stent-related complications. Another trend is the emergence of drug-eluting stents, which are coated with medications to help prevent restenosis and improve patient outcomes. These advancements are expected to further drive market growth in the coming years.</p></p>

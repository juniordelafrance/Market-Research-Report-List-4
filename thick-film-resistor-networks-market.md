<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Film Resistor Networks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-In-Line</li><li>Dual-In-Line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick Film Resistor Networks are commonly available in two market types: Single-In-Line (SIL) and Dual-In-Line (DIL). SIL resistor networks have all resistor elements arranged in a single row with a common pin at one end, making them ideal for compact designs. On the other hand, DIL resistor networks feature two rows of resistor elements with two common pins at each end, offering higher component density and parallel resistance configurations. Both types are widely used in electronic circuits for precision resistance applications.</p></p>

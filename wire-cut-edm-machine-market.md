<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wire-cut EDM Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wire-Cut Flushing Type EDM</li><li>Wire-Cut Submerge Type EDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wire-cut EDM machines are divided into two main types: Wire-Cut Flushing Type EDM and Wire-Cut Submerge Type EDM. The Wire-Cut Flushing Type EDM uses a continuous flow of dielectric fluid to flush away debris and maintain accuracy during the cutting process. On the other hand, the Wire-Cut Submerge Type EDM submerges the workpiece and electrode in dielectric fluid to prevent sparking and reduce wear on the wire. These two types cater to different needs and preferences in the market.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beamline Manipulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Motorised</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beamline manipulators can be classified into two types - manual and motorised. Manual manipulators are operated by hand and require physical effort to adjust the position of the beamline. They are generally more cost-effective but may be less precise than motorised manipulators. Motorised manipulators, on the other hand, are controlled electronically and can be adjusted with greater precision and accuracy. They are typically more expensive but offer increased efficiency and ease of use. Both types of manipulators cater to different market segments based on their specific needs and requirements.</p></p>

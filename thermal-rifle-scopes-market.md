<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Rifle Scopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal rifle scopes market can be categorized into two main types: Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging and Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging. Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging scopes use materials that are sensitive to infrared radiation, converting it into heat and then into an electrical signal. On the other hand, Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging scopes use liquid nitrogen or other cryogens to cool the detector, resulting in higher sensitivity and better image quality. Both types serve the same purpose of detecting heat signatures and providing visibility in low-light conditions for hunters and law enforcement.</p></p>

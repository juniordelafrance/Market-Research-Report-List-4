<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Greenhouse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroponic</li><li>Non-Hydroponic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intelligent Greenhouse is a system that utilizes technology to monitor and control the environment inside a greenhouse to optimize plant growth. There are two main types of markets for Intelligent Greenhouses: Hydroponic and Non-Hydroponic. Hydroponic markets utilize a soilless method of growing plants, where nutrients are delivered directly to plant roots in a water-based solution. Non-Hydroponic markets, on the other hand, involve traditional soil-based methods of cultivation. Both markets benefit from the use of intelligent greenhouse technology to improve crop yields and quality.</p></p>

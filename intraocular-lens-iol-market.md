<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens (IOL) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular lenses (IOL) are artificial lenses implanted in the eye to replace the natural lens during cataract surgery. There are two main types of IOLs: non-foldable lenses and foldable lenses. Non-foldable lenses are made of rigid materials and require a larger incision for implantation, while foldable lenses are made of flexible materials that can be inserted through a smaller incision, resulting in quicker recovery times and less post-operative complications. Both types of IOLs have their own set of advantages and are chosen based on the patient's specific needs.</p></p>

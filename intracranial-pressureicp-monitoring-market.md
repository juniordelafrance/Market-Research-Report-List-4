<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure(ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring market includes both invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring pressure within the skull. Invasive ICP monitors involve placing a probe directly into the brain tissue, providing accurate and real-time measurements but carrying a risk of infection. Non-invasive ICP monitors, on the other hand, use external devices such as ultrasound or MRI to indirectly measure pressure changes in the brain, offering a safer alternative for patients but potentially less precise results. Both types play a vital role in managing conditions such as traumatic brain injury or hydrocephalus.</p></p>

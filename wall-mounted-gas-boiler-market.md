<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Mounted Gas Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall-mounted gas boilers are available in two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing boilers are known for their high efficiency, as they are designed to make use of waste heat by condensing water vapor in the flue gas to recover the latent heat. On the other hand, non-condensing boilers do not utilize this process and typically have lower efficiency levels. Both types have their own advantages and it is important for consumers to consider their specific heating needs when choosing between the two.</p></p>

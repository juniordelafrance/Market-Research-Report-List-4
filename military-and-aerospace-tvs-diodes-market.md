<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military and Aerospace TVS Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar TVS</li><li>Bi-polar TVS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military and Aerospace TVS Diodes are classified into two types - Uni-polar TVS and Bi-polar TVS. Uni-polar TVS diodes are designed to protect against overvoltage events by diverting excess electrical current away from sensitive components in one direction only. Bi-polar TVS diodes, on the other hand, provide protection in both directions, making them suitable for applications where bidirectional protection is needed. Both types of TVS diodes play a critical role in safeguarding military and aerospace electronics from voltage transients and surges.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TiO2 Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TiO2 pigment market is divided into two main types: sulfate process and chloride process. The sulfate process involves the reaction of titanium ore with sulfuric acid to produce TiO2 pigment. This method is widely used due to its cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, the chloride process involves the reaction of titanium ore with chlorine gas to produce a higher quality TiO2 pigment. This method is more expensive but produces a finer pigment suitable for specialized applications. Both processes have their own advantages and are used in different industries.</p></p>

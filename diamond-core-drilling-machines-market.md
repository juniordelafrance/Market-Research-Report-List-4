<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diamond Core Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Diamond Core Drilling Machines</li><li>Dry Diamond Core Drilling Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diamond core drilling machines are categorized into two types based on the method of drilling - wet diamond core drilling machines and dry diamond core drilling machines. Wet diamond core drilling machines use water or a coolant to reduce friction and heat during the drilling process, which helps to prolong the life of the drill bits and increase drilling speed. On the other hand, dry diamond core drilling machines do not use any coolant, making them suitable for drilling in areas where water cannot be used or is not easily accessible.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermodynamic</li><li>Mechanical</li><li>Thermostatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steam traps are crucial components in steam systems that are used to remove condensate and non-condensable gases while preventing steam from escaping. There are three main types of steam traps: thermodynamic, mechanical, and thermostatic. Thermodynamic traps operate based on the principle of fluid dynamics, mechanical traps use moving parts to discharge condensate, and thermostatic traps rely on temperature changes to open and close. Each type has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and flow rate.</p></p>
